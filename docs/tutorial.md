!!! note "Getting help"

    Running the `noseyparker` binary without arguments prints top-level help and exits.
    You can get abbreviated help for a particular command by running `noseyparker COMMAND -h`.
    More detailed help is available with the `help` command or long-form `--help` option.

    The prebuilt releases also include manpages that collect the command-line help in one place.
    These manpages converted into Markdown format are also included in the repository [here](v0.17.0/man/man1).

    If you have a question that's not answered by this documentation, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/discussions/new/choose).
